Reading file 'c:\projekt\espfluke\ver1\run5\espfluke.laf'... 
32583 WARNING: Pin 'CLK_IN' is in external pin file but not in design; 
      pin 'CLK_IN' is ignored 
  
Checking design rules... 
Selected part is 'ispLSI1032E-70LJ84' 
32504 WARNING: Attribute 'Y1_AS_RESET ON' is not valid for part 
      'ispLSI1032E-70LJ84'; attribute 'Y1_AS_RESET ON' is ignored

33581 WARNING: Register 'UQBN_B134' is not observable from any output 
      pin; register is removed 
  
Trying to move PT reset signal to global reset pin... 
      PT reset signal cannot be moved to global reset pin 
      In order to move PT reset signal to global reset pin, the 
      following conditions need to be satisfied: 
      1. There exists at least one pin which drives all register's reset
      signals 
      2. This pin is unlocked 
      3. This pin does not drive any data signals 
      4. This pin can be disjointly decomposed with other pins, if any, 
      which drive reset signals 
  
Partitioning logic into 11-input, 11-input with DIs, functions to 
      minimize delay... 
  
Extracting LXOR2 gates to minimize delay... 
  
Packing functions into GLBs using 11 inputs and 4 outputs per GLB to 
      minimize delay... 
34506 WARNING: OE net 'UQNN_N26' comes from an IOC or drives logic 
      besides three-state buffers; buffer 'BUF_1959' is inserted to 
      generate PT OE 
Constant VCC drives register 'TRIGGER_SIG' data input
