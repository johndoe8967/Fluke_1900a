Trying to move PT reset signal to global reset pin... 
      PT reset signal cannot be moved to global reset pin 
      In order to move PT reset signal to global reset pin, the 
      following conditions need to be satisfied: 
      1. There exists at least one pin which drives all register's reset
      signals 
      2. This pin is unlocked 
      3. This pin does not drive any data signals 
      4. This pin can be disjointly decomposed with other pins, if any, 
      which drive reset signals

Estimated number of levels with the above area increase constraint is 2 
  
Final solution may require more than 2 level(s) because there exist, on 
      the critical/turbo path, 1 signal(s) with more than 16 inputs 
      and/or more than 20 product terms: 
      Signal '[882]' has 17 inputs and 3 product terms
