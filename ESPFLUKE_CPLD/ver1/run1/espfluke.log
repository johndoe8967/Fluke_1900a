Trying to move PT reset signal to global reset pin... 
      PT reset signal cannot be moved to global reset pin 
      In order to move PT reset signal to global reset pin, the 
      following conditions need to be satisfied: 
      1. There exists at least one pin which drives all register's reset
      signals 
      2. This pin is unlocked 
      3. This pin does not drive any data signals 
      4. This pin can be disjointly decomposed with other pins, if any, 
      which drive reset signals

34506 WARNING: OE net 'UQNN_N26' comes from an IOC or drives logic 
      besides three-state buffers; buffer 'BUF_4379' is inserted to 
      generate PT OE
