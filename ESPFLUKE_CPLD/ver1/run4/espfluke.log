32583 WARNING: Pin 'CLK_IN' is in external pin file but not in design; 
      pin 'CLK_IN' is ignored

Selected part is 'ispLSI1032E-70LJ84' 
32504 WARNING: Attribute 'Y1_AS_RESET ON' is not valid for part 
      'ispLSI1032E-70LJ84'; attribute 'Y1_AS_RESET ON' is ignored

Optimizing logic with high effort... 
33581 WARNING: Register 'UQBN_B134' is not observable from any output 
      pin; register is removed 
  
Trying to move PT reset signal to global reset pin... 
      PT reset signal cannot be moved to global reset pin 
      In order to move PT reset signal to global reset pin, the 
      following conditions need to be satisfied: 
      1. There exists at least one pin which drives all register's reset
      signals 
      2. This pin is unlocked 
      3. This pin does not drive any data signals 
      4. This pin can be disjointly decomposed with other pins, if any, 
      which drive reset signals 
  
Partitioning logic into 16-input, 18-input with DIs, functions to 
      minimize area... 
  
Estimated number of functions for the present 3-level netlist is 77 
  
Maximum number of functions for part 'ispLSI1032E-70LJ84' is 128 
  
Collapsing the netlist by relaxing product term and input constraints to
      find minimum level solution subject to the area increase limit of
      1.66... 
  
Estimated number of levels with the above area increase constraint is 2 
  
Final solution may require more than 2 level(s) because there exist, on 
      the critical/turbo path, 1 signal(s) with more than 16 inputs 
      and/or more than 20 product terms: 
      Signal '[882]' has 17 inputs and 3 product terms 
Partitioning logic into 16-input, 18-input with DIs, functions to 
      minimize area... 
  
Extracting LXOR2 gates to minimize area... 
  
Packing functions into GLBs using 16 inputs and 4 outputs per GLB to 
      minimize area... 
34506 WARNING: OE net 'UQNN_N26' comes from an IOC or drives logic 
      besides three-state buffers; buffer 'BUF_2437' is inserted to 
      generate PT OE 
Constant VCC drives register 'TRIGGER_SIG' data input 
  
Synthesis and partitioning statistics: 
  
Number of Macrocells is 79 
Number of GLBs is 24 
Number of product terms is 205 
Maximum number of GLB levels is 3 
Average number of inputs per GLB is 10.4 
Average number of outputs per GLB is 3.3 
Average number of product terms per GLB is 8.5
